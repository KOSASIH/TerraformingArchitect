    """
    
    # Define the resource requirements based on the parameter combinations
    resource_requirements = []
    
    if composition == "rocky":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])

    for row in resource_requirements[1:]:
        markdown_table += "|".join(map(str, row)) + "\n"

Example usage:
```python
resource_table = calculate_resource_requirements(1000, "rocky", "oxygen-rich")
print(resource_table)
```

Output:
```
|Size|Composition|Atmospheric Conditions|Materials|Energy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1000|rocky|oxygen-rich|1000000|100000|
```

Note: The calculations for materials and energy requirements are just placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate formulas based on the specific requirements of terraforming celestial bodies.

## Embed A 3D Model

```markdown
To embed a 3D model of a planet or celestial body in a markdown document, you can use the following code snippet:

```html
<iframe src="https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
```

Replace "https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" with the actual URL of your 3D model. Adjust the width and height attributes as per your preference.

To generate a 3D model of a planet or celestial body, you can use a 3D modeling software like Blender. Here's a script that demonstrates how to generate a simple 3D model of a planet using Blender's Python API:

```python
import bpy

# Clear existing scene
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
bpy.ops.object.select_by_type(type='MESH')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Create a sphere
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=5, location=(0, 0, 0))

# Apply a material to the sphere
bpy.context.object.data.materials.append(bpy.data.materials['Planet Material'])

# Set up the rendering settings
bpy.context.scene.render.engine = 'CYCLES'
bpy.context.scene.cycles.samples = 100

# Render the 3D model
bpy.ops.render.render(write_still=True)

# Save the rendered image
bpy.data.images['Render Result'].save_render(filepath='planet.png')
```

This script creates a simple sphere representing a planet, applies a material to it, and renders the 3D model. The rendered image is saved as "planet.png". You can customize this script to create more complex 3D models by modifying the shape, materials, and rendering settings.

Remember to install Blender and its Python API before running this script. You can find more information about Blender's Python API in the official documentation.

Once you have the 3D model and the rendered image, you can upload them to a 3D model hosting service or your own website. Then, use the provided code snippet to embed the 3D model in your markdown document.

## Build Machine Learning Model

```

To build a machine learning model that predicts the long-term effects of terraforming on a celestial body's ecosystem, we can use a supervised learning approach. We will need a dataset that includes information about the initial conditions of the celestial body, the changes made during terraforming, and the resulting ecosystem changes. Here's an example of how you can train and use the model using Python and scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('terraforming_dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = dataset.drop('ecosystem_changes', axis=1)
y = dataset['ecosystem_changes']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the random forest regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the mean squared error
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

In this example, we assume that you have a dataset called "terraforming_dataset.csv" that contains the necessary information for training the model. The dataset should include columns for the initial conditions, terraforming changes, and the resulting ecosystem changes.

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by calling the `predict()` method on the trained model. For example:

```python
# New data for prediction
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'initial_conditions': [0.5, 0.7, 0.3],
    'terraforming_changes': [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
})

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)

# Print the predictions
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict the ecosystem changes based on new data.

Please note that this code is a basic example and may need to be adapted to your specific dataset and requirements. Additionally, it's important to have a well-curated and diverse dataset to train an accurate model for predicting the long-term effects of terraforming on a celestial body's ecosystem.

## Generate Heat Map 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_heat_map(atmospheric_composition, land_cover, solar_radiation):
    # Define temperature ranges based on atmospheric composition
    temperature_ranges = {
        'oxygen': (0, 30),
        'nitrogen': (-10, 20),
        'carbon_dioxide': (-20, 10)
    }
    
    # Define land cover temperature modifiers
    land_cover_modifiers = {
        'water': -5,
        'forest': 2,
        'desert': 5
    }
    
    # Calculate temperature changes based on atmospheric composition
    temperature_change = temperature_ranges[atmospheric_composition]
    
    # Apply land cover temperature modifiers
    temperature_change += land_cover_modifiers[land_cover]
    
    # Apply solar radiation effect
    temperature_change += solar_radiation
    
    # Generate heat map
    heat_map = np.random.uniform(temperature_change[0], temperature_change[1], size=(100, 100))
    
    # Plot heat map
    plt.imshow(heat_map, cmap='hot', origin='lower')
    plt.colorbar(label='Temperature (Â°C)')
    plt.title('Heat Map of Terraformed Celestial Body')
    plt.xlabel('Longitude')
    plt.ylabel('Latitude')
    plt.show()

# Example usage
generate_heat_map(atmospheric_composition='nitrogen', land_cover='forest', solar_radiation=10)
```

This script generates a heat map visualization of the temperature changes on a terraformed celestial body. The temperature changes are calculated based on factors such as atmospheric composition, land cover, and solar radiation. The script uses predefined temperature ranges for different atmospheric compositions and land cover temperature modifiers to determine the temperature changes. It then generates a random heat map using the calculated temperature changes and plots it using matplotlib.

## Simulate Organism Growth 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_organism_growth(organism_population, resource_availability, competition_factor, generations):
    """
    Simulates the growth and evolution of introduced organisms on a terraformed celestial body.
    
    Args:
    - organism_population (float): Initial population of the introduced organisms.
    - resource_availability (float): Availability of resources for the organisms.
    - competition_factor (float): Factor representing the competition for resources.
    - generations (int): Number of generations to simulate.
    
    Returns:
    - List[float]: List of population sizes for each generation.
    """
    population_sizes = [organism_population]
    
    for _ in range(generations):
        population = population_sizes[-1]
        new_population = population + (resource_availability * population) - (competition_factor * population**2)
        population_sizes.append(new_population)
    
    return population_sizes

# Example usage
initial_population = 1000
resource_availability = 0.8
competition_factor = 0.001
generations = 10

population_sizes = simulate_organism_growth(initial_population, resource_availability, competition_factor, generations)

# Plotting the population sizes over generations
plt.plot(range(generations + 1), population_sizes)
plt.xlabel('Generation')
plt.ylabel('Population Size')
plt.title('Organism Population Growth')
plt.show()
```

This code defines a function `simulate_organism_growth` that simulates the growth and evolution of introduced organisms on a terraformed celestial body. It takes into account factors such as population dynamics, resource availability, and competition for resources.

To use the function, you need to provide the initial population of the introduced organisms (`organism_population`), the availability of resources for the organisms (`resource_availability`), the competition factor representing the competition for resources (`competition_factor`), and the number of generations to simulate (`generations`).

The function returns a list of population sizes for each generation. You can then use this data for further analysis or visualization.

In the example usage, the function is called with some example values, and the resulting population sizes are plotted using matplotlib. The x-axis represents the generations, and the y-axis represents the population size.

## Design User Interface

To design the user interface for a terraforming simulation tool, we can make use of the Python library called `PySimpleGUI`. This library provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating GUI applications. Here's an example of how you can use `PySimpleGUI` to create the interface:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Define the layout of the interface
layout = [
    [sg.Text('Celestial Body Characteristics')],
    [sg.Text('Size:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Terrain:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Atmosphere:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('')],
    [sg.Text('Desired Atmospheric Conditions')],
    [sg.Text('Composition:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Temperature:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('')],
    [sg.Text('Ecosystem Constraints')],
    [sg.Text('Land Cover:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Solar Radiation:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('')],
    [sg.Button('Run Simulation')]
]

# Create the window using the layout
window = sg.Window('Terraforming Simulation', layout)

# Event loop to process user input
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    
    # If the window is closed or the "Run Simulation" button is clicked, exit the loop
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED or event == 'Run Simulation':
        break

    # Process the user input and perform the simulation
    # Your code for terraforming simulation goes here

# Close the window
window.close()
```

You can customize the layout according to your specific requirements by adding or removing input fields and labels. Once the user clicks the "Run Simulation" button, you can retrieve the input values from the `values` dictionary and use them to perform the terraforming simulation.

Please note that the code provided above is only for creating the user interface using `PySimpleGUI`. You would need to add your own code for the terraforming simulation based on the provided parameters.

## Generate Heat Map Visualization 

To generate a heat map visualization of temperature changes on a terraformed celestial body, we can use Python and the Matplotlib library. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data for temperature changes
# Replace this with your own data or calculations
temperature_data = np.random.rand(10, 10)

# Create a heat map visualization
plt.imshow(temperature_data, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')
plt.colorbar(label='Temperature')
plt.title('Temperature Changes on Terraformed Celestial Body')
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')

# Customize the colorbar
colorbar = plt.colorbar()
colorbar.set_label('Temperature')

# Save the visualization to a file
plt.savefig('temperature_heatmap.png')

# Show the visualization
plt.show()
```

In this code snippet, we first generate sample data for temperature changes on the celestial body. You would need to replace this with your own data or calculations based on factors such as atmospheric composition, land cover, and solar radiation.

We then create a heat map visualization using `plt.imshow()`, specifying the colormap (`'hot'`) and interpolation method (`'nearest'`). We add a colorbar to indicate the temperature scale and provide a title, labels for the x and y axes, and a colorbar label.

Finally, we save the visualization to a file (`temperature_heatmap.png`) and display it using `plt.show()`.

Please note that this code snippet is a starting point and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and data.

## Simulate Organism Growth

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_organism_growth(celestial_body, organisms, duration):
    """
    Simulate the growth and evolution of introduced organisms on a terraformed celestial body.
    
    Args:
    - celestial_body (CelestialBody): The terraformed celestial body object.
    - organisms (list): List of Organism objects representing the introduced organisms.
    - duration (int): The duration of the simulation in time steps.
    
    Returns:
    - List of population sizes for each organism at each time step.
    """
    population_sizes = [[] for _ in range(len(organisms))]
    
    for t in range(duration):
        # Calculate available resources for each organism
        available_resources = celestial_body.available_resources()
        
        for i, organism in enumerate(organisms):
            # Calculate the growth rate based on resource availability and competition
            growth_rate = organism.calculate_growth_rate(available_resources)
            
            # Update the population size based on the growth rate
            population_size = organism.population_size * growth_rate
            organism.population_size = population_size
            
            # Store the population size at each time step
            population_sizes[i].append(population_size)
    
    return population_sizes

class CelestialBody:
    def __init__(self, atmospheric_composition, temperature, resource_availability):
        self.atmospheric_composition = atmospheric_composition
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.resource_availability = resource_availability
    
    def available_resources(self):
        # Calculate and return the available resources based on the celestial body's characteristics
        return self.resource_availability

class Organism:
    def __init__(self, population_size, growth_rate_parameters):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.growth_rate_parameters = growth_rate_parameters
    
    def calculate_growth_rate(self, available_resources):
        # Calculate and return the growth rate based on the available resources and growth rate parameters
        return np.prod(available_resources) * self.growth_rate_parameters
```

To use the `simulate_organism_growth` function, you would need to create instances of `CelestialBody` and `Organism` classes, and pass them along with the desired duration to the function. The function will return a list of population sizes for each organism at each time step.

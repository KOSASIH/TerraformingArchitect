```python
def calculate_resource_requirements(size, composition, atmospheric_conditions):
    """
    Calculate the required resources for terraforming a celestial body based on specific parameters.
    
    Parameters:
    - size: The size of the celestial body (e.g., radius in kilometers).
    - composition: The composition of the celestial body (e.g., rocky, gaseous, icy).
    - atmospheric_conditions: The desired atmospheric conditions (e.g., oxygen level, greenhouse gases).
    
    Returns:
    - Markdown table with the resource requirements for each parameter combination.
    """
    
    # Define the resource requirements based on the parameter combinations
    resource_requirements = []
    
    if composition == "rocky":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])
        
        if atmospheric_conditions == "oxygen-rich":
            materials = size * 1000  # Example calculation for materials requirement
            energy = size * 100  # Example calculation for energy requirement
            resource_requirements.append([size, composition, atmospheric_conditions, materials, energy])
        
        elif atmospheric_conditions == "nitrogen-rich":
            materials = size * 500  # Example calculation for materials requirement
            energy = size * 50  # Example calculation for energy requirement
            resource_requirements.append([size, composition, atmospheric_conditions, materials, energy])
        
        # Add more conditions and calculations based on other atmospheric conditions if needed
        
    elif composition == "gaseous":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])
        
        # Add calculations for resource requirements based on gaseous composition
        
    elif composition == "icy":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])
        
        # Add calculations for resource requirements based on icy composition
    
    # Add more conditions and calculations based on other composition types if needed
    
    # Convert the resource requirements into a markdown table
    markdown_table = "|".join(resource_requirements[0]) + "\n"
    markdown_table += "|".join(["---"] * len(resource_requirements[0])) + "\n"
    
    for row in resource_requirements[1:]:
        markdown_table += "|".join(map(str, row)) + "\n"
    
    return markdown_table
```

Example usage:
```python
resource_table = calculate_resource_requirements(1000, "rocky", "oxygen-rich")
print(resource_table)
```

Output:
```
|Size|Composition|Atmospheric Conditions|Materials|Energy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1000|rocky|oxygen-rich|1000000|100000|
```

Note: The calculations for materials and energy requirements are just placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate formulas based on the specific requirements of terraforming celestial bodies.

```markdown
To embed a 3D model of a planet or celestial body in a markdown document, you can use the following code snippet:

```html
<iframe src="https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
```

Replace "https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" with the actual URL of your 3D model. Adjust the width and height attributes as per your preference.

To generate a 3D model of a planet or celestial body, you can use a 3D modeling software like Blender. Here's a script that demonstrates how to generate a simple 3D model of a planet using Blender's Python API:

```python
import bpy

# Clear existing scene
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
bpy.ops.object.select_by_type(type='MESH')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Create a sphere
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=5, location=(0, 0, 0))

# Apply a material to the sphere
bpy.context.object.data.materials.append(bpy.data.materials['Planet Material'])

# Set up the rendering settings
bpy.context.scene.render.engine = 'CYCLES'
bpy.context.scene.cycles.samples = 100

# Render the 3D model
bpy.ops.render.render(write_still=True)

# Save the rendered image
bpy.data.images['Render Result'].save_render(filepath='planet.png')
```

This script creates a simple sphere representing a planet, applies a material to it, and renders the 3D model. The rendered image is saved as "planet.png". You can customize this script to create more complex 3D models by modifying the shape, materials, and rendering settings.

Remember to install Blender and its Python API before running this script. You can find more information about Blender's Python API in the official documentation.

Once you have the 3D model and the rendered image, you can upload them to a 3D model hosting service or your own website. Then, use the provided code snippet to embed the 3D model in your markdown document.
```

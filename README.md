    """
    
    # Define the resource requirements based on the parameter combinations
    resource_requirements = []
    
    if composition == "rocky":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])

    for row in resource_requirements[1:]:
        markdown_table += "|".join(map(str, row)) + "\n"
    
    return markdown_table
```

Example usage:
```python
resource_table = calculate_resource_requirements(1000, "rocky", "oxygen-rich")
print(resource_table)
```

Output:
```
|Size|Composition|Atmospheric Conditions|Materials|Energy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1000|rocky|oxygen-rich|1000000|100000|
```

Note: The calculations for materials and energy requirements are just placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate formulas based on the specific requirements of terraforming celestial bodies.

## Embed A 3D Model

```markdown
To embed a 3D model of a planet or celestial body in a markdown document, you can use the following code snippet:

```html
<iframe src="https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
```

Replace "https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" with the actual URL of your 3D model. Adjust the width and height attributes as per your preference.

To generate a 3D model of a planet or celestial body, you can use a 3D modeling software like Blender. Here's a script that demonstrates how to generate a simple 3D model of a planet using Blender's Python API:

```python
import bpy

# Clear existing scene
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
bpy.ops.object.select_by_type(type='MESH')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Create a sphere
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=5, location=(0, 0, 0))

# Apply a material to the sphere
bpy.context.object.data.materials.append(bpy.data.materials['Planet Material'])

# Set up the rendering settings
bpy.context.scene.render.engine = 'CYCLES'
bpy.context.scene.cycles.samples = 100

# Render the 3D model
bpy.ops.render.render(write_still=True)

# Save the rendered image
bpy.data.images['Render Result'].save_render(filepath='planet.png')
```

This script creates a simple sphere representing a planet, applies a material to it, and renders the 3D model. The rendered image is saved as "planet.png". You can customize this script to create more complex 3D models by modifying the shape, materials, and rendering settings.

Remember to install Blender and its Python API before running this script. You can find more information about Blender's Python API in the official documentation.

Once you have the 3D model and the rendered image, you can upload them to a 3D model hosting service or your own website. Then, use the provided code snippet to embed the 3D model in your markdown document.

## Build Machine Learning Model

```

To build a machine learning model that predicts the long-term effects of terraforming on a celestial body's ecosystem, we can use a supervised learning approach. We will need a dataset that includes information about the initial conditions of the celestial body, the changes made during terraforming, and the resulting ecosystem changes. Here's an example of how you can train and use the model using Python and scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('terraforming_dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = dataset.drop('ecosystem_changes', axis=1)
y = dataset['ecosystem_changes']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the random forest regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the mean squared error
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

In this example, we assume that you have a dataset called "terraforming_dataset.csv" that contains the necessary information for training the model. The dataset should include columns for the initial conditions, terraforming changes, and the resulting ecosystem changes.

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by calling the `predict()` method on the trained model. For example:

```python
# New data for prediction
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'initial_conditions': [0.5, 0.7, 0.3],
    'terraforming_changes': [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
})

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)

# Print the predictions
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict the ecosystem changes based on new data.

Please note that this code is a basic example and may need to be adapted to your specific dataset and requirements. Additionally, it's important to have a well-curated and diverse dataset to train an accurate model for predicting the long-term effects of terraforming on a celestial body's ecosystem.

## Generate Heat Map 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_heat_map(atmospheric_composition, land_cover, solar_radiation):
    # Define temperature ranges based on atmospheric composition
    temperature_ranges = {
        'oxygen': (0, 30),
        'nitrogen': (-10, 20),
        'carbon_dioxide': (-20, 10)
    }
    
    # Define land cover temperature modifiers
    land_cover_modifiers = {
        'water': -5,
        'forest': 2,
        'desert': 5
    }
    
    # Calculate temperature changes based on atmospheric composition
    temperature_change = temperature_ranges[atmospheric_composition]
    
    # Apply land cover temperature modifiers
    temperature_change += land_cover_modifiers[land_cover]
    
    # Apply solar radiation effect
    temperature_change += solar_radiation
    
    # Generate heat map
    heat_map = np.random.uniform(temperature_change[0], temperature_change[1], size=(100, 100))
    
    # Plot heat map
    plt.imshow(heat_map, cmap='hot', origin='lower')
    plt.colorbar(label='Temperature (Â°C)')
    plt.title('Heat Map of Terraformed Celestial Body')
    plt.xlabel('Longitude')
    plt.ylabel('Latitude')
    plt.show()

# Example usage
generate_heat_map(atmospheric_composition='nitrogen', land_cover='forest', solar_radiation=10)
```

This script generates a heat map visualization of the temperature changes on a terraformed celestial body. The temperature changes are calculated based on factors such as atmospheric composition, land cover, and solar radiation. The script uses predefined temperature ranges for different atmospheric compositions and land cover temperature modifiers to determine the temperature changes. It then generates a random heat map using the calculated temperature changes and plots it using matplotlib.

## Simulate Organism Growth 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_organism_growth(organism_population, resource_availability, competition_factor, generations):
    """
    Simulates the growth and evolution of introduced organisms on a terraformed celestial body.
    
    Args:
    - organism_population (float): Initial population of the introduced organisms.
    - resource_availability (float): Availability of resources for the organisms.
    - competition_factor (float): Factor representing the competition for resources.
    - generations (int): Number of generations to simulate.
    
    Returns:
    - List[float]: List of population sizes for each generation.
    """
    population_sizes = [organism_population]
    
    for _ in range(generations):
        population = population_sizes[-1]
        new_population = population + (resource_availability * population) - (competition_factor * population**2)
        population_sizes.append(new_population)
    
    return population_sizes

# Example usage
initial_population = 1000
resource_availability = 0.8
competition_factor = 0.001
generations = 10

population_sizes = simulate_organism_growth(initial_population, resource_availability, competition_factor, generations)

# Plotting the population sizes over generations
plt.plot(range(generations + 1), population_sizes)
plt.xlabel('Generation')
plt.ylabel('Population Size')
plt.title('Organism Population Growth')
plt.show()
```

This code defines a function `simulate_organism_growth` that simulates the growth and evolution of introduced organisms on a terraformed celestial body. It takes into account factors such as population dynamics, resource availability, and competition for resources.

To use the function, you need to provide the initial population of the introduced organisms (`organism_population`), the availability of resources for the organisms (`resource_availability`), the competition factor representing the competition for resources (`competition_factor`), and the number of generations to simulate (`generations`).

The function returns a list of population sizes for each generation. You can then use this data for further analysis or visualization.

In the example usage, the function is called with some example values, and the resulting population sizes are plotted using matplotlib. The x-axis represents the generations, and the y-axis represents the population size.

## Design User Interface

To design the user interface for a terraforming simulation tool, we can make use of the Python library called `PySimpleGUI`. This library provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating GUI applications. Here's an example of how you can use `PySimpleGUI` to create the interface:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Define the layout of the interface
layout = [
    [sg.Text('Celestial Body Characteristics')],
    [sg.Text('Size:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Terrain:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Atmosphere:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('')],
    [sg.Text('Desired Atmospheric Conditions')],
    [sg.Text('Composition:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Temperature:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('')],
    [sg.Text('Ecosystem Constraints')],
    [sg.Text('Land Cover:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('Solar Radiation:', size=(15, 1)), sg.InputText()],
    [sg.Text('')],
    [sg.Button('Run Simulation')]
]

# Create the window using the layout
window = sg.Window('Terraforming Simulation', layout)

# Event loop to process user input
while True:
    event, values = window.read()
    
    # If the window is closed or the "Run Simulation" button is clicked, exit the loop
    if event == sg.WINDOW_CLOSED or event == 'Run Simulation':
        break

    # Process the user input and perform the simulation
    # Your code for terraforming simulation goes here

# Close the window
window.close()
```

You can customize the layout according to your specific requirements by adding or removing input fields and labels. Once the user clicks the "Run Simulation" button, you can retrieve the input values from the `values` dictionary and use them to perform the terraforming simulation.

Please note that the code provided above is only for creating the user interface using `PySimpleGUI`. You would need to add your own code for the terraforming simulation based on the provided parameters.

## Generate Heat Map Visualization 

To generate a heat map visualization of temperature changes on a terraformed celestial body, we can use Python and the Matplotlib library. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data for temperature changes
# Replace this with your own data or calculations
temperature_data = np.random.rand(10, 10)

# Create a heat map visualization
plt.imshow(temperature_data, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')
plt.colorbar(label='Temperature')
plt.title('Temperature Changes on Terraformed Celestial Body')
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')

# Customize the colorbar
colorbar = plt.colorbar()
colorbar.set_label('Temperature')

# Save the visualization to a file
plt.savefig('temperature_heatmap.png')

# Show the visualization
plt.show()
```

In this code snippet, we first generate sample data for temperature changes on the celestial body. You would need to replace this with your own data or calculations based on factors such as atmospheric composition, land cover, and solar radiation.

We then create a heat map visualization using `plt.imshow()`, specifying the colormap (`'hot'`) and interpolation method (`'nearest'`). We add a colorbar to indicate the temperature scale and provide a title, labels for the x and y axes, and a colorbar label.

Finally, we save the visualization to a file (`temperature_heatmap.png`) and display it using `plt.show()`.

Please note that this code snippet is a starting point and may need to be customized based on your specific requirements and data.

## Simulate Organism Growth

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_organism_growth(celestial_body, organisms, duration):
    """
    Simulate the growth and evolution of introduced organisms on a terraformed celestial body.
    
    Args:
    - celestial_body (CelestialBody): The terraformed celestial body object.
    - organisms (list): List of Organism objects representing the introduced organisms.
    - duration (int): The duration of the simulation in time steps.
    
    Returns:
    - List of population sizes for each organism at each time step.
    """
    population_sizes = [[] for _ in range(len(organisms))]
    
    for t in range(duration):
        # Calculate available resources for each organism
        available_resources = celestial_body.available_resources()
        
        for i, organism in enumerate(organisms):
            # Calculate the growth rate based on resource availability and competition
            growth_rate = organism.calculate_growth_rate(available_resources)
            
            # Update the population size based on the growth rate
            population_size = organism.population_size * growth_rate
            organism.population_size = population_size
            
            # Store the population size at each time step
            population_sizes[i].append(population_size)
    
    return population_sizes

class CelestialBody:
    def __init__(self, atmospheric_composition, temperature, resource_availability):
        self.atmospheric_composition = atmospheric_composition
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.resource_availability = resource_availability
    
    def available_resources(self):
        # Calculate and return the available resources based on the celestial body's characteristics
        return self.resource_availability

class Organism:
    def __init__(self, population_size, growth_rate_parameters):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.growth_rate_parameters = growth_rate_parameters
    
    def calculate_growth_rate(self, available_resources):
        # Calculate and return the growth rate based on the available resources and growth rate parameters
        return np.prod(available_resources) * self.growth_rate_parameters
```

To use the `simulate_organism_growth` function, you would need to create instances of `CelestialBody` and `Organism` classes, and pass them along with the desired duration to the function. The function will return a list of population sizes for each organism at each time step.

## Design User Interface 

To design a user interface for a terraforming simulation tool, we can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an example of how the interface can be implemented:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Terraforming Simulation Tool</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS styles for the interface */
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }

    .container {
      max-width: 600px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      padding: 20px;
    }

    label {
      display: block;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }

    input[type="number"],
    select {
      width: 100%;
      padding: 5px;
      border-radius: 3px;
      border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }

    button {
      padding: 10px 20px;
      background-color: #4CAF50;
      color: #fff;
      border: none;
      border-radius: 3px;
      cursor: pointer;
    }

    #result {
      margin-top: 20px;
      padding: 10px;
      background-color: #f5f5f5;
      border-radius: 3px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Terraforming Simulation Tool</h1>

    <form id="simulationForm">
      <label for="celestialBody">Celestial Body:</label>
      <select id="celestialBody">
        <option value="earth">Earth</option>
        <option value="mars">Mars</option>
        <option value="venus">Venus</option>
        <!-- Add more celestial bodies as needed -->
      </select>

      <label for="atmosphericConditions">Desired Atmospheric Conditions:</label>
      <input type="text" id="atmosphericConditions" placeholder="e.g., oxygen-rich, nitrogen-dominated">

      <label for="ecosystemConstraints">Ecosystem Constraints:</label>
      <input type="text" id="ecosystemConstraints" placeholder="e.g., water-based, diverse flora and fauna">

      <button type="submit">Run Simulation</button>
    </form>

    <div id="result"></div>
  </div>

  <script>
    // JavaScript code to handle the form submission and run the simulation
    const form = document.getElementById('simulationForm');
    const resultDiv = document.getElementById('result');

    form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();

      // Get the selected celestial body, atmospheric conditions, and ecosystem constraints
      const celestialBody = document.getElementById('celestialBody').value;
      const atmosphericConditions = document.getElementById('atmosphericConditions').value;
      const ecosystemConstraints = document.getElementById('ecosystemConstraints').value;

      // Perform the simulation and display the result
      const simulationResult = runSimulation(celestialBody, atmosphericConditions, ecosystemConstraints);
      resultDiv.textContent = simulationResult;
    });

    function runSimulation(celestialBody, atmosphericConditions, ecosystemConstraints) {
      // Add your terraforming simulation logic here
      // This function should return the result of the simulation

      // Example simulation result
      return `Simulation result for ${celestialBody}:
        - Atmospheric conditions: ${atmosphericConditions}
        - Ecosystem constraints: ${ecosystemConstraints}
        - Terraforming success: 80%`;
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a simple user interface with a form that allows users to input the desired parameters for the terraforming simulation. When the user submits the form, the JavaScript code handles the form submission, runs the simulation based on the provided parameters, and displays the result in a designated div element.

Please note that this code is just a basic example and may need to be customized or extended based on specific requirements or additional functionality desired for the terraforming simulation tool.

## Generate Heat Map 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generate_heatmap(temperature_data):
    # Calculate the temperature range for the color map
    min_temp = np.min(temperature_data)
    max_temp = np.max(temperature_data)
    
    # Create a figure and axis for the heat map
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    
    # Generate the heat map
    heatmap = ax.imshow(temperature_data, cmap='hot', vmin=min_temp, vmax=max_temp)
    
    # Add a colorbar to the heat map
    cbar = fig.colorbar(heatmap, ax=ax)
    
    # Set the title and labels for the heat map
    ax.set_title('Temperature Changes on Terraformed Celestial Body')
    ax.set_xlabel('Longitude')
    ax.set_ylabel('Latitude')
    
    # Show the heat map
    plt.show()

# Example usage
temperature_data = np.random.rand(10, 10)  # Replace with actual temperature data
generate_heatmap(temperature_data)
```

This script generates a heat map visualization of the temperature changes on a terraformed celestial body. The `temperature_data` variable should be replaced with the actual temperature data for the celestial body.

The script uses the `numpy` library to generate random temperature data for demonstration purposes. In practice, you would replace this with the actual temperature data obtained from your simulation or model.

The `matplotlib.pyplot` library is used to create the heat map visualization. The `generate_heatmap` function takes the temperature data as input and generates the heat map plot. The color map is set to 'hot', which represents higher temperatures with warmer colors. The minimum and maximum temperature values are used to set the color range of the heat map.

The resulting heat map plot includes a colorbar to indicate the temperature scale, as well as a title and labels for the axes. The plot is displayed using `plt.show()`.

            }
            
            new_organisms_state.append(new_organism_state)
        
        organisms_state = new_organisms_state
    
    return organisms_state
```

Example usage:

```python
celestial_body = np.array([[0.5, 0.8, 0.2],
                           [0.3, 0.4, 0.6],
                           [0.9, 0.7, 0.1]])

organisms = [
    {
        'name': 'Organism A',
        'population': 100,
        'reproduction_rate': 0.1,
        'mortality_rate': 0.05,
        'resource_consumption_rate': 0.2,
        'competition_factor': 0.1
    },
    {
        'name': 'Organism B',
        'population': 50,
        'reproduction_rate': 0.05,
        'mortality_rate': 0.1,
        'resource_consumption_rate': 0.1,
        'competition_factor': 0.2
    }
]

time_steps = 10

result = simulate_organism_growth(celestial_body, organisms, time_steps)
print(result)
```

This function `simulate_organism_growth` takes in a 2D numpy array representing the celestial body's terrain or environment, a list of dictionaries representing the introduced organisms with their initial properties, and the number of time steps to simulate. It returns a list of dictionaries representing the final state of the organisms after the simulation.

The function iterates over the time steps and for each organism, calculates the growth rate based on available resources, population, mortality rate, and competition factor. It then updates the population based on the growth rate and the organism's state. The simulation continues for the specified number of time steps and returns the final state of the organisms.

The example usage demonstrates how to use the function by providing a celestial body terrain, organisms with their initial properties, and the number of time steps. It then prints the final state of the organisms after the simulation.

## Design User Interface 

To design a user interface for a terraforming simulation tool, we can make use of a graphical user interface (GUI) library such as Tkinter in Python. Tkinter provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating windows, buttons, input fields, and other GUI components.

Here's a markdown code snippet that demonstrates how to design the user interface and run a terraforming simulation:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def run_simulation():
    # Get user inputs
    celestial_body = celestial_body_entry.get()
    atmospheric_conditions = atmospheric_conditions_entry.get()
    ecosystem_constraints = ecosystem_constraints_entry.get()

    # Perform terraforming simulation
    # Your code for the terraforming simulation goes here

    # Display simulation results
    simulation_results_label.config(text="Simulation completed!")

# Create the main window
window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Terraforming Simulation Tool")

# Create input fields for celestial body characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and ecosystem constraints
celestial_body_label = tk.Label(window, text="Celestial Body:")
celestial_body_label.pack()
celestial_body_entry = tk.Entry(window)
celestial_body_entry.pack()

atmospheric_conditions_label = tk.Label(window, text="Atmospheric Conditions:")
atmospheric_conditions_label.pack()
atmospheric_conditions_entry = tk.Entry(window)
atmospheric_conditions_entry.pack()

ecosystem_constraints_label = tk.Label(window, text="Ecosystem Constraints:")
ecosystem_constraints_label.pack()
ecosystem_constraints_entry = tk.Entry(window)
ecosystem_constraints_entry.pack()

# Create a button to run the simulation
run_simulation_button = tk.Button(window, text="Run Simulation", command=run_simulation)
run_simulation_button.pack()

# Create a label to display simulation results
simulation_results_label = tk.Label(window, text="")
simulation_results_label.pack()

# Start the GUI event loop
window.mainloop()
```

To use the interface, you can copy the code snippet into a Python file and run it. It will open a window with input fields for celestial body characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and ecosystem constraints. After entering the desired parameters, click the "Run Simulation" button to initiate the terraforming simulation. The simulation results will be displayed in the label below the button.

Please note that the code provided only demonstrates the user interface design and does not include the actual terraforming simulation logic. You would need to implement the terraforming simulation code within the `run_simulation` function to perform the desired calculations and generate the results. 

## Generate 3D Visualization 

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
import numpy as np

def generate_3d_visualization(land_cover, atmospheric_composition, elevation):
    # Generate grid of coordinates
    x = np.linspace(0, 1, land_cover.shape[1])
    y = np.linspace(0, 1, land_cover.shape[0])
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

    # Create figure and 3D axes
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

    # Plot land cover as surface
    ax.plot_surface(X, Y, land_cover, cmap='terrain')

    # Set labels and title
    ax.set_xlabel('X')
    ax.set_ylabel('Y')
    ax.set_zlabel('Z')
    ax.set_title('Terraformed Celestial Body')

    # Set elevation data as color
    ax.scatter(X, Y, elevation, c=elevation, cmap='viridis')

    # Show atmospheric composition as colorbar
    cbar = plt.colorbar(ax.scatter([], [], [], c=[], cmap='viridis'))
    cbar.set_label('Atmospheric Composition')

    # Show the 3D visualization
    plt.show()

# Example usage
land_cover = np.random.rand(10, 10)
atmospheric_composition = np.random.rand(10, 10)
elevation = np.random.rand(10, 10)

generate_3d_visualization(land_cover, atmospheric_composition, elevation)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to generate a 3D visualization of a terraformed celestial body. The `generate_3d_visualization` function takes three input arrays: `land_cover`, `atmospheric_composition`, and `elevation`. 

The `land_cover` array represents the land cover of the celestial body, where higher values indicate more land or solid surface. The `atmospheric_composition` array represents the atmospheric composition, where higher values indicate a higher concentration of a particular gas or element. The `elevation` array represents the elevation of the celestial body, where higher values indicate higher elevations.

The script uses matplotlib to create a 3D plot. It generates a grid of coordinates based on the shape of the input arrays. It then plots the `land_cover` as a surface using a terrain colormap. The `elevation` data is represented as color, where higher values are shown with a different color. The `atmospheric_composition` is shown as a colorbar.

Finally, an example usage is provided where random arrays are used as input. You can replace these arrays with your own data to visualize the terraformed celestial body based on the specific factors you are interested in.

## Calculate Energy Requirement

To calculate the energy requirements for maintaining the desired atmospheric conditions on a terraformed celestial body, you can use the following function:

```python
def calculate_energy_requirements(atmospheric_composition, temperature, solar_radiation):
    # Constants
    specific_heat_capacity = 1000  # J/kgÂ·K
    surface_area = 4 * 3.14 * (radius ** 2)  # Assuming a spherical celestial body
    time_period = 24 * 60 * 60  # Time period for which energy requirements are calculated (in seconds)

    # Calculate energy requirements
    energy_requirements = specific_heat_capacity * surface_area * temperature * time_period

    # Adjust energy requirements based on atmospheric composition and solar radiation
    if atmospheric_composition == "oxygen":
        energy_requirements *= 1.2  # Increase energy requirements for oxygen-rich atmospheres
    elif atmospheric_composition == "carbon_dioxide":
        energy_requirements *= 1.5  # Increase energy requirements for carbon dioxide-rich atmospheres

    if solar_radiation == "high":
        energy_requirements *= 1.2  # Increase energy requirements for high solar radiation
    elif solar_radiation == "low":
        energy_requirements *= 0.8  # Decrease energy requirements for low solar radiation

    return energy_requirements
```

To use the function and calculate the energy requirements, you can call it with the appropriate parameters:

```python
atmospheric_composition = "oxygen"
temperature = 25  # Celsius
solar_radiation = "high"

energy_requirements = calculate_energy_requirements(atmospheric_composition, temperature, solar_radiation)
print(f"The energy requirements for maintaining the desired atmospheric conditions are {energy_requirements} Joules.")
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the function to calculate the energy requirements for maintaining the desired atmospheric conditions on a terraformed celestial body. You can customize the values of `atmospheric_composition`, `temperature`, and `solar_radiation` to suit your specific scenario.

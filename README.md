```python
def calculate_resource_requirements(size, composition, atmospheric_conditions):
    """
    Calculate the required resources for terraforming a celestial body based on specific parameters.
    
    Parameters:
    - size: The size of the celestial body (e.g., radius in kilometers).
    - composition: The composition of the celestial body (e.g., rocky, gaseous, icy).
    - atmospheric_conditions: The desired atmospheric conditions (e.g., oxygen level, greenhouse gases).
    
    Returns:
    - Markdown table with the resource requirements for each parameter combination.
    """
    
    # Define the resource requirements based on the parameter combinations
    resource_requirements = []
    
    if composition == "rocky":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])
        
        if atmospheric_conditions == "oxygen-rich":
            materials = size * 1000  # Example calculation for materials requirement
            energy = size * 100  # Example calculation for energy requirement

            energy = size * 50  # Example calculation for energy requirement
            resource_requirements.append([size, composition, atmospheric_conditions, materials, energy])
        
        # Add more conditions and calculations based on other atmospheric conditions if needed
        
    elif composition == "gaseous":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])
        
        # Add calculations for resource requirements based on gaseous composition
        
    elif composition == "icy":
        resource_requirements.append(["Size", "Composition", "Atmospheric Conditions", "Materials", "Energy"])
        
        # Add calculations for resource requirements based on icy composition
    
    # Add more conditions and calculations based on other composition types if needed
    
    # Convert the resource requirements into a markdown table
    markdown_table = "|".join(resource_requirements[0]) + "\n"
    markdown_table += "|".join(["---"] * len(resource_requirements[0])) + "\n"
    
    for row in resource_requirements[1:]:
        markdown_table += "|".join(map(str, row)) + "\n"
    
    return markdown_table
```

Example usage:
```python
resource_table = calculate_resource_requirements(1000, "rocky", "oxygen-rich")
print(resource_table)
```

Output:
```
|Size|Composition|Atmospheric Conditions|Materials|Energy|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1000|rocky|oxygen-rich|1000000|100000|
```

Note: The calculations for materials and energy requirements are just placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate formulas based on the specific requirements of terraforming celestial bodies.

```markdown
To embed a 3D model of a planet or celestial body in a markdown document, you can use the following code snippet:

```html
<iframe src="https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
```

Replace "https://your-3d-model-website.com/your-model" with the actual URL of your 3D model. Adjust the width and height attributes as per your preference.

To generate a 3D model of a planet or celestial body, you can use a 3D modeling software like Blender. Here's a script that demonstrates how to generate a simple 3D model of a planet using Blender's Python API:

```python
import bpy

# Clear existing scene
bpy.ops.object.select_all(action='DESELECT')
bpy.ops.object.select_by_type(type='MESH')
bpy.ops.object.delete()

# Create a sphere
bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_uv_sphere_add(radius=5, location=(0, 0, 0))

# Apply a material to the sphere
bpy.context.object.data.materials.append(bpy.data.materials['Planet Material'])

# Set up the rendering settings
bpy.context.scene.render.engine = 'CYCLES'
bpy.context.scene.cycles.samples = 100

# Render the 3D model
bpy.ops.render.render(write_still=True)

# Save the rendered image
bpy.data.images['Render Result'].save_render(filepath='planet.png')
```

This script creates a simple sphere representing a planet, applies a material to it, and renders the 3D model. The rendered image is saved as "planet.png". You can customize this script to create more complex 3D models by modifying the shape, materials, and rendering settings.

Remember to install Blender and its Python API before running this script. You can find more information about Blender's Python API in the official documentation.

Once you have the 3D model and the rendered image, you can upload them to a 3D model hosting service or your own website. Then, use the provided code snippet to embed the 3D model in your markdown document.
```
## Build Machine Learning Model

To build a machine learning model that predicts the long-term effects of terraforming on a celestial body's ecosystem, we can use a supervised learning approach. We will need a dataset that includes information about the initial conditions of the celestial body, the changes made during terraforming, and the resulting ecosystem changes. Here's an example of how you can train and use the model using Python and scikit-learn:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('terraforming_dataset.csv')

# Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = dataset.drop('ecosystem_changes', axis=1)
y = dataset['ecosystem_changes']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the random forest regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the mean squared error
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

In this example, we assume that you have a dataset called "terraforming_dataset.csv" that contains the necessary information for training the model. The dataset should include columns for the initial conditions, terraforming changes, and the resulting ecosystem changes.

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by calling the `predict()` method on the trained model. For example:

```python
# New data for prediction
new_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'initial_conditions': [0.5, 0.7, 0.3],
    'terraforming_changes': [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]
})

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)

# Print the predictions
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the trained model to predict the ecosystem changes based on new data.

Please note that this code is a basic example and may need to be adapted to your specific dataset and requirements. Additionally, it's important to have a well-curated and diverse dataset to train an accurate model for predicting the long-term effects of terraforming on a celestial body's ecosystem.
